# Pip requirements file for zhmccli runtime dependencies.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also
# the minimum versions required in requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt.
