If logon options and ZHMC_* environment variables are both provided, the
logon options now take precedence, and the environment variables are ignored.
As a result, a provided ZHMC_SESSION_ID variable is now ignored when logon
options are also provided. Previously, a provided ZHMC_SESSION_ID variable was
used when logon options were also provided.
