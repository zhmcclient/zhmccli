Test: Added an end2end test concept. A new pytest fixture 'zhmc_session' can
now be used to create logged-on sessions with the HMC for use by end2end test
functions. The run_zhmc() function has been simplified to just run zhmc,
and the more complex prior version of that function that can set up arbitrary
HMC session files has been moved to the test_session.py module which is the
only module that needs it.
