Made the CSV quoting consistent for all Python versions. Previously, on
Python 3.12 and higher, complex types were only quoted when needed and
None became an unquoted empty string, and on Python 3.11 and lower, complex
types are always quoted and None becomes a quoted empty string. Now, complex
types are always quoted and None becomes a quoted empty string, on all Python
versions. Depending on how the generated CSV output is processed, this may
be an incompatible change on Python 3.12 and higher.
