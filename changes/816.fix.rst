Fixed that inaccessible objects referenced by users via URI caused the
'zhmc user show' and 'zhmc user list --permissions' commands to fail with
KeyError. Such situations are now tolerated and the object names that
cannot be determined are shown as "(unknown)" in the command output.
Applied similar toleration support also to the 'zhmc userrole show' and
'zhmc userrole list --permissions' commands.
