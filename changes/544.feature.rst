New 'zhmc session logon/logoff' commands are provided. They manage the session
in a '.zhmc_sessions.yaml' file in the user's home directory. This is more
convenient for users compared to the existing 'zhmc session create/delete'
commands which store the session in environment variables and display the
export/unset commands to do that. The new commands also support Windows out
of the box.
